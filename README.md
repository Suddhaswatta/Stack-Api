# Stack-Api
Stack API implemented using Generics and Iterable
Why Generics?
Before generics any datastructures had type specific implementations using JAVA Generics now we have one implementtaions for different types
Why Iterable?
Using interface we can iterate through any Data-Structures using foreach loops 
Which is better LinkedList vs Array?
Linked List better for fast individual operations while using Array we can get good overall average performance
Which is better in terms of JAVA?
Linked List because it allows use of Generics while in case Array we have to use cast which is a bad coding practice.
